## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First of all, I'm french and apologies for my english.

I learned a lot about positioning and how mobile first design save a lot of time. 

I didn't know about media querries when i was doing this challenge. I think some media querries would help me to tidy up the responsive in the future.

### Continued development

I started coding 2 month ago ( July 2022), so I'll just keep doing challenges to pratcice everything.

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's Youtube channel help me a lot, especially with flexbox/grid
